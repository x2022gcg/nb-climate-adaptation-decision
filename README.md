# nb-climate-adaptation-decision 
Policy backgrounder analyzing a climate adaptation funding decision in New Brunswick, examining trade-offs between coastal flood-protection infrastructure and long-term forest-based resilience strategies.

## Decision Statement 
Should the New Brunswick Minister of Natural Resources and Energy Development prioritize public funding for coastal flood-protection infrastructure (such as dikes and seawalls) or invest in forest-based carbon sequestration and wildfire-resilience programs to address climate risks?
## Executive Summary 
Rising sea levels, storm surges, flooding along the coast, and increasing stress on forest ecosystems are just a few of the climate-related threats that New Brunswick is dealing with. Public safety, housing, infrastructure, and important economic sectors including tourism, forestry, and fisheries are all at risk. Provincial decision-makers have to decide how to split limited preservation resources in ways that reduce long-term vulnerability while managing current concerns as the effects of climate change rise.

The main choice this project looks at is whether public funding should go toward forest-based resilience strategies like carbon storage, better forest management, and wildfire risk reduction or engineered coastal flood-protection measures like dikes, seawalls, and other protective infrastructure.
Investments in coastal infrastructure can offer those in danger quick and visible protection, but they are expensive and may have negative ecological effects. Even if they take longer to provide verifiable protection, forest-based strategies have longer-term advantages like reducing emissions, increasing ecosystem health, and lowering the risk of disasters in both rural and inland areas.

The two choices of unbalanced distribution of costs and benefits across stakeholder groups and geographical areas, as well as the unpredictable nature of climate change, make this decision extremely difficult but critical. Selecting one strategy over another could limit the future flexibility and influence New Brunswick's adaptation to climate change strategy for years. Making an effective and effective policy decision consequently demands an understanding of the feedback they receive, delays, and unintended consequences related to each choice.

## CLD Diagram Description
The CLD diagram shows us how climate change has the ability to increase coastal flood risk and infrastructure damage, driving investmentin flood-protection infrastructure that could encourage further coastal development and support long-term risk (R1). The balamcing loop has thr ability to capture how rising adaptation  spending creates fiscal pressure that constrains additional investment (B1). The second balancing loop illustrates how investment in forest-based resilience strengths long-term climate resilience, reducing future climate impacts and stabilizing the system over time (B2).
