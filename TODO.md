* Download some data.  I think you need to decide how to measure impact - if financial, then get data that costs out damage due to coastal flooding (looks like a manual activity with the data you offered) or if displacement - population flows by coastal communities, etc.
* Compare to global trends for flooding https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.CLC.MDAT.ZS
* Fire: https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart/download/nfdbpnt
* Use tableau prep to build a dataset by time, cost, city/prov - you might have to pivot to look at national trends, not just NB because of availability of data
